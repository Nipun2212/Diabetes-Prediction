## Project- Healthcare 
**Problem Statement:**
* `NIDDK (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases)` research creates knowledge about and treatments for the most chronic, costly, and consequential diseases.
* The dataset used in this project is originally from NIDDK. The objective is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset.
* Build a model to accurately predict whether the patients in the dataset have diabetes or not.

I worked on this capstone project towards completion of final assessment for Data Science Masters Program from Simplilearn. 

My job was to analyze the datasets from NIDDK consisting of several medical predictor variables and one target variable (Outcome). Predictor variables includes the number of pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and more. I created and trained a number of Machine Learning models using various classification algorithms for prediction of diabetes in patients. 

**Tasks Performed:**
* `Data Cleaning`
* `Data Transformation`
* `Exploratory data analysis` : EDA is one of the most important step in data science project life cycle to inferences from the visualizations and data analysis.
* `Data Modeling` - various classification models
* `Data Modeling` - performance evaluation using various metrics

**Variables - Description**

* Pregnancies - Number of times pregnant
* Glucose - Plasma glucose concentration in an oral glucose tolerance test
* BloodPressure - Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
* SkinThickness - Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
* Insulin - Two hour serum insulin
* BMI - Body Mass Index
* DiabetesPedigreeFunction - Diabetes pedigree function
* Age - Age in years
* Outcome - Class variable (either 0 or 1). 268 of 768 values are 1, and the others are 0
